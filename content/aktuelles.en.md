![Summer Classes 2024](../../slider_kurse_sommer_2024.png)

The 6-week summer classes start on **June 19, 2024**, and run until **July 24, 2024**. **Registration is open.** More information can be found on the [Dance classes]({{< ref "/tanzkurse" >}} "Dance Classes") page.

### Minor Swing
Minor Swing takes place regularly on Wednesdays from 7:30 PM in our Calloway dance studio. During the summer, if the weather is good, Minor Swing will not be held in Calloway. Instead, many dancers meet at the Inselteich in Clara-Zetkin-Park.
