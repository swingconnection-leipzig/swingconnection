### Calloway Dance Studio

In September 2015, we opened our dance studio in the center of Leipzig – Calloway. On several evenings a week, Calloway hosts dance courses in Lindy Hop, Balboa, Collegiate Shag, Authentic Jazz, and other dance styles of the Swing era. The name Calloway is a nod to the American bandleader, jazz singer, saxophonist, and dancer [Cab Calloway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cab_Calloway), who rose to fame through his performances at the legendary [Cotton Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Club) in the 1930s.

The studio features a dance hall with bright, springy parquet floors and window fronts facing the courtyard. The large dance floor with mirror wall provides optimal conditions for dance courses, shows, and club training. We also host workshops and swing parties here. In addition to the dance hall with seating area, which can also be used as a stage for live bands, the studio includes an entrance area with a shoe changing room and a bar room. The studio has two gender-neutral restrooms. One restroom has only individual cabins, while the other has urinals and individual cabins, as well as a shower. There is a gender-neutral changing room with a wardrobe between the kitchen and bay window, but without individual cabins.
