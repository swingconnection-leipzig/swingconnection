> Note: During the summer, if the weather is good, Minor Swing will not take place at Calloway. Instead, many dancers meet at the Inselteich in Clara-Zetkin-Park.

Finally, put the hard-learned dance material into practice, dance freely, chat about dance, or just watch and be amazed. **Every Wednesday from 7:30 PM**, Minor Swing takes place in our dance studio **Calloway**. Minor Swing is our weekly social dance for Lindy Hop, Balboa, Charleston, and Shag. The DJs of SwingConnection provide varied music, from authentic Swing of the 30s to today's Neo-Swing. Admission is free. Beginners and interested people are always welcome.
