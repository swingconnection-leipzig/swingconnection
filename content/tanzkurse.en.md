### Course Notes
- Please note our [Code of Conduct](../../Code_of_Conduct_-_Kurse.pdf).
- You do not need to register in pairs; you can register individually.
- Dance partners are regularly changed during the courses. If you do not want to switch, you do not have to.
- You can choose flexibly in the course whether you want to practice as a follow or lead. You can also stick to one role.
- The instructors are encouraged to use gender-neutral language. Generally, the terms leader and follower (neutral terms) are used, and everyone can decide which role they want to dance.
- The courses are held in German, but can also be given in English if needed.
- Please be punctual for the courses and allow time for changing clothes and shoes.
- If you cannot attend a class, please send a short email to your instructors.
- We recommend wearing comfortable, flat, clean sneakers or dance shoes. High heels are less suitable.
- If you have a cold or feel sick, please stay home.

### Venue Notes
- The courses take place in our dance studio [Calloway]({{< ref "/calloway" >}} "Calloway") and sometimes on Wednesdays in Noels Ballroom. Both venues are not barrier-free.
- You are not allowed to enter the dance floor with street shoes, only with dance or clean sports shoes. You can change your shoes in the entrance area of Calloway or in the shoe changing room halfway up the stairs.
- Calloway has gender-neutral toilets. One restroom has only single cabins, one has urinals and single cabins, as well as a shower. The restrooms are labeled according to these features.
- There is a changing room with a wardrobe between the kitchen and bay window, which is also gender-neutral but without single cabins.
