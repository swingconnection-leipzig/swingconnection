Dance courses are common, but we Swing dancers want more! After work, it's time to play. In our case, we offer events for free dancing, camps, and workshops! Here you get an overview of what the SwingConnection organizes outside of the regular courses.

We announce our events in advance under [News]({{< ref "/aktuelles" >}} "News").

### Minor Swing
Finally, test the hard-learned dance material in practice, dance freely, chat about dance, or just watch and be amazed. **Every Wednesday from 7:30 PM**, the Minor Swing takes place in our dance studio **Calloway**. Minor Swing is our weekly social dance for Lindy Hop, Balboa, Charleston, and Shag. The DJs of the SwingConnection provide varied music, ranging from authentic Swing of the 30s to today's Neo-Swing. Admission is free. Beginners and interested people are always welcome. You can find more information on the [Minor Swing]({{< ref "/minorswing" >}} "Minor Swing") page.

### Friday Night Balboa
At regular intervals, we invite you to Friday Night Balboa. You can find more information on the [Friday Night Balboa]({{< ref "/fridaynightbalboa" >}} "Friday Night Balboa") page.

### Swing Tea Time
At regular intervals, we invite you to Swing Tea Time. Our dance studio will then be filled with the scent of freshly baked cakes and the sound of Louis Armstrong, Django Reinhardt, or Ella Fitzgerald. Admission is free. Beginners and interested people are always welcome. You can find more information on the [Swing Tea Time]({{< ref "/swingteatime" >}} "Swing Tea Time") page.

### Spring Camp Mattstedt
The highlights of the year are our camps every spring and summer. Out into the green and, depending on your preference, either chill out or dance. The Spring Camp at MÃ¼hlenhof in Mattstedt is aimed at both beginner dancers and those who have been dancing for a while. Here, you have a whole weekend of just Swing on your mind and get to know your course mates and other instructors better. You can find more information on the [Mattstedt]({{< ref "/mattstedt" >}} "Mattstedt") page.

### Open House Day
Once or twice a year, we hold an Open House Day, where we present our association and offer trial lessons for the different dances you can learn with us. You can find more information on the [Open House Day]({{< ref "/opendoor" >}} "Open House Day") page.

### Swing Brunch
At regular intervals, we organize a Swing Brunch.

### Workshops
On individual weekends, we offer small and larger workshops. These include learning a Swing routine, reinforcing basics, or learning new moves. We also offer weekend intensive courses for beginners.

### Performances and Trial Courses for Private Events
We also offer performances and trial courses for private events such as weddings, birthdays, and company parties. Feel free to email us at info@swingconnection-leipzig.com.
