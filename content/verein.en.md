Our association, SwingConnection Leipzig e.V., is a community of dance enthusiasts from Leipzig dedicated to the music and dances of the Swing era. We continuously offer dance courses at various levels and organize different Swing events. As a non-profit organization, we put all our energy into promoting and spreading Swing dances and the culture they have carried for decades. Currently, we have about 120 members who practice, dance, celebrate, participate in competitions, and spread the spirit of Swing dances around the world.

You can read an overview of SwingConnection's development since 2000 on the page [**Our Association History**]({{< ref "/geschichte" >}} "Our Association History").
